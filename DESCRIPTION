Version: 0.1.2
Author: James Roose
Maintainer: James Roose <jroose9@gmail.com>
Description: Contains functions to comparing and evaluating binary classifiers. 
	Base functions calculate metrics: sensitivity, specificity, ppv, npv at a 
	specified classification threshold or constraint on another metric. Extensions
	of cvAUC package are used to compare cross-validated binary classifiers based 
	on estimates of the influence function of cvAUC. Also contains framework for
	an extension to area under precision recall curve.
